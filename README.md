# RetroIO (rio)

A command-line utility written in the Go programming language for working
with disk and cassette tape files used by emulators of home computers from
the 1980s.

One example would be `tzx` tapes from the ZX Spectrum 8-bit home computer.


## Supported Media and Commands


### Geometry Command

* Amstrad:      `DSK`, `CDT`
* Commodore 64: `D64`, `D71`, `D81`, `T64`, `TAP`
* ZX Spectrum:  `TZX`, `TAP`

The `geometry` command will read and display core metadata about the layout
of the media. This can be disk track and sector details, or the header and
block information from a cassette tape.


### Directory Command

* Amstrad:      `DSK`
* Commodore 64: `D64`, `D71`, `D81`

The `dir` command reads a disk and prints the directory listing to the terminal.
Any hidden files will also be displayed.


### Read Command

* ZX Spectrum: `TZX` and `TAP`

The `read` command will read data contained on the media.

At present only printing of `BASIC` programs is supported. Simply add the `--bas`
flag when `read`ing the media image.

_Please note that decoding is currently experimental and the output may not be
considered valid BASIC, and may even be garbled or missing completely._


## Installation

    $ go get -u -v github.com/mrcook/retroio/...

To install the app after manually cloning the repository you must first change to the `rio` directory:

    $ cd retroio/rio
    $ go install


## Usage

    $ rio spectrum geometry /path/to/tape.tzx

Reads the media geometry and prints the details to the terminal.

The program will select the correct media type for the requested system, based
on the file extension, however this can be overridden with the `--media` flag.


### Examples

```sh
$ rio spectrum geometry /path/to/tape.tzx
